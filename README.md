------------------------------------------
For more, head out to [my site](http://kevin.h-pk-ns.com/) or to the [Appcelerator Developer Center](http://developer.appcelerator.com).


# Android and iOS Users:
-----------------------
Implementation is currently iOS only. iCal like looks and functionality are not doable on the Android platform

# Questions?
------------
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask on my[blog](http://kevin.h-pk-ns.com/blog).


# Usage:
--------
include the necessary lib files in your application code.  When the date selector window needs to be created,
simple fire an eventListener calling createDatePickerWin() with a few pre-instantiated, named variables.
